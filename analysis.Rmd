# Worksheet: Version Control

*Note: data used in this simple analysis is from [UCL Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).*

Load the required libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in the data.
`mutate` the final grade `G3` to a percentage value
(note that the value given is a score out of 20).
Lastly, `select` only the `absences` column and the `G3` column.

```{r}
students <- read_delim("student-mat.csv", delim = ";") |> 
  mutate(G3 = (G3 / 20) * 100) |> 
  filter(absences, G3)
```

Plot the relationship between `absences` and `G3` (final grade) as a scatter-plot,
with `absences` on the X-axis and `G3` on the y-axis.
Be sure to include a title and readable axis labels.

```{r}
plot <- NULL
```
